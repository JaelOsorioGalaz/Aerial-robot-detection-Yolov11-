# Aerial Robot Detection using YOLOv11

This repository contains a demonstrative computer vision project for the **aerial detection of mobile robots** using **YOLOv11**, developed as part of an academic thesis.

The system focuses on detecting ground mobile robots from an aerial perspective (e.g., UAV or drone footage) and demonstrates the full inference pipeline using a trained YOLO model.
